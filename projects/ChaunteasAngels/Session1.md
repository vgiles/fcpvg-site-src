# Session 1

Our adventurers, initially called The Taverners*, began at Stonehill Inn Inn in Phandalin, having spent a couple of nights there after their arrival. At the beginning they had not yet teamed up. Upon a little encouragement, and lead by Aeryth Barkheuoouse, they started working together. The Inn Keeper (Toblen Stonehill) notes that they appear to be adventurers, and there haven't been many of those around recently. But given some of the rumours floating around, it's probably a nice thing. He gives them all their money back for the few nights and food and offers free board and basic food for another few nights while they find their bearings. 

- Weather: clear skies, relatively strong wind. 
- 10am

The Taverners head to the Shrine of Luck in the hope of getting some luck from a deity. On the way, Aeryth picks some flowers to leave at the shrine. When they arrive, Mercy produces (from somewhere unknown) a roast chicken that had been kept for two days from the Inn, and leaves it as an offering. This suggests a little bit of her past in a cult, and what may have been done in that context. The chicken was probably at least partially off. Nobody was around at the shrine/temple so they move on to the Townmaster's Hall to check out the jobs board, and find that there are three jobs available. After some discussion they decide to head south to Umbrage Hill to help the local midwife, an acolyte of Chauntea named Adabra Gwynn, due to rumours of a dragon in the area. Upon arrival they see that a manticore is trying to break down the door to the windmill in which Adabra lives. She is on the second level, sees The Taverners approach, and asks for some help. 

- Weather: clear skies, relatively strong wind
- 2pm

The Taverners discuss what to do about the manticore, with some attempts made to lure it away with somehow-procured cured meats by Aeryth. This doesn't work, but they notice that it might be interested. They encourage Adabra to throw down a steak, which the manticore immediately eats. Eventually they engage with the manticore after some attempts to approach it by Kratos with animal handling, that only partially worked. Aeryth communicates with the manticore using questions in common, whilst the manticore responds using yes/no sign with its spiked tail. Eventually they discover the manticore is hungry, and has been driven out of its home by the dragon (thus verifying the existence of the dragon for the Taverners). They also learn it has a friend elsewhere, and so begins the negotiation. Aeryth convinces Adabra to give up one of her two chickens for the manticore, who doesn't kill it, but takes it in its mouth. After some further communication, they surrender 10gp as well, which the manticore for reasons unknown eats. It then grabs the chicken in its mouth again and flies off. 

- Weather: clear skies, relatively strong wind
- 4pm

The Taverners talk to Adabra who offers them a 50% discount on a Potion of Healing, as well as an item she had found somewhere in the area. She declines to return to Phandalin as the Townmaster had requested, but instead gives the party a note to take back in lieu. As the party prepares to leave, Adabra throws another potion of healing, having reconsidered being stingy in light of the manticore assist. Aeryth suggests a name for the party in light of this successful, non-violent quest, of Chauntea's Angels. They head back to Phandalin to return the note.

- Weather: clear skies, strong wind
- 7pm

They head to the Townmasters' house, turn in the quest, receive 25gp, and reach level 2. They then head to the Inn. On the way they meet an apparent villager named Brin, who they ask about the shrine/temple, noticing that the chicken and flowers were still there. They ask Brin about it, and Brin says that it is normally attended by Sister Garaele, who is not in town at the moment. After some more conversation they invite Brin to the inn for dinner and a drink. Upon arrival, Brin announces loudly to the tavern that the skies have spoken to them, and that there is something catastrophic coming. That everybody should be prepared for this. 

- 10pm
- Weather: unseasonable cold snap. Snow (not coating the ground). It will probably pass quickly. 

They eat their food and Kratos convinces Toblen that he should sing a song for the inn. Unfortunately, he gets the attention of everybody then proceeds to vomit all over them. Dinner, drink, and some unknown things. This loses rep for Kratos for the rest of the day, costs 1gp in cleanup bill, and Kratos no longer has free board and basic food. Brin, having just been vomited on, leaves the Inn. Aeryth goes after them, and as they both leave it is apparent that the weather has dramatically changed, with flurries of snow, dark clouds, and so on. As it is so close to summer, this is particularly unexpected. An astute observer might wonder whether Brin's "sky omens" were just this cold snap? 

- 10:30pm
- Weather: cold snap.

Afterwards, Aeryth makes an announcement that they are looking for jobs/work because they help the underdogs, Mercy notices someone at the Inn who appears to want to talk. This person challenges Aeryth's claim, noting that they look kind of rogueish. Aeryth then tells a story of a village that she saved from an oppressor in the past. This convinces the person, but unfortunately Mercy scolds them for doubting in the first place. This makes Aeryth the only person they'll talk to. They disclose that they've heard rumours of gold out past Triboar Trail, and of a strange person who appears after dusk every so often at the Inn. 

Prior to wrapping up for the night, Aeryth is again talking to Toblen, and notices that there is a greatsword hanging behind the bar. Is it purely ornamental? 

The adventurers head to bed.
