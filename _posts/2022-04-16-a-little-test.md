I'm tired today. But, I've been thinking a bit about blogging, and maybe this is a site to do it. Substack is also an option (and subscribeable - that's so not a word), or maybe both? I dunno. The trouble is, I'm not really sure what to write about. I suppose, for the sake of making this post meaningful to me, I should outline a few key things that I need to do to this site:

* Add in some analytics.
* Look into ads/adsense.
* Think of what to write about...? 
* Go from there.
